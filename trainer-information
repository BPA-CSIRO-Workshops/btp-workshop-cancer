THIS IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT 

This is a brief description of how to organise and run the Cancer Genomics Workshop including tips on how to organise the days, interactive activities and sections that can cause issues. This is not an exhaustive list of tips for organising the Cancer Genomics Workshops and the ideal way to run this workshop will depend on the attendee experience, expectations and trainers preference. 

#Background 
The Cancer Genomics Workshop was developed as part of an ongoing collaboration with EMBL-EBI. 8 Australia trainers attended an EMBL-EBI Cancer Genomics Workshop, followed by a 2-day train-the-trainer workshop. The Australian cohort of trainers used content, themes and concepts from the EMBL-EBI workshop and modified them to suit Australian audiences. The team also utilised material and infrastructure developed from previous Bioplatforms-CSIRO workshops. This workshop consists of the following modules:

Introduction to Command-line 
Fundamentals in NGS (presentation)
NGS Quality Control
Read Alignment with BWA
Single Nucleotide Variant Call and Annotation
Copy Number Variation
Structural Variant Analysis
Variants Visualization
Somatic Mutation Analysis

The order the Introduction to Command-line and Fundamentals in NGS often change depending on the attendee experience with the command-line (time required to deliver the command-line module) and trainers preference. 

#Modules
This section describes some considerations and tips for optimal delivery of content. Workshop timetable attached here for your reference. Please note that times often change to ensure the workshop is completed in whole, with time often taken from breaks (lunch breaks less than 30min not recommended). 

## Optional - Ice-breaker section 

Please see ice-breaker questionnaire attached here: 

##Introduction to Command-line 
The time to run this section is very dependant on the confidence and programming experience of the attendees. It is always good to allow extra time in this section, if the attends have no experience with the command-line. 

There are advance sections of this module, that can be difficult for even the most advanced attendee (or trainer) and have been including to occupy attendees with strong programming experience and not intended for all attendees. It is often important to make this clear so attendees do not feel nervous about the command-line. 

##Fundamentals in NGS (presentation)
This presentation is updated before each workshop particularly if there has been a recent technological development.
